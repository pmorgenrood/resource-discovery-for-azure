    CollectorBreakerAndVisibility.Tests.ps1

    THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. A resource type whose collector threw serialised as an empty array,
    exactly like a type the subscription genuinely does not own, and Extension/Summary.ps1 drops any
    zero-count service, so the type vanished from the HTML with no trace on the page.

    Worse, the circuit breaker meant to stop a systemic failure was INERT. With the global
    $ErrorActionPreference at SilentlyContinue - which is what ResourceInventory.ps1 sets outside
    -Debug - a `throw` from inside a catch neither halted the run nor left the enclosing foreach, so
    every remaining collector ran on and recorded @(): precisely the "incomplete report that looks
    like an empty environment" the breaker's own message promises to prevent, and the run exited 0.

    That premise is NOT asserted here on purpose. Whether a `throw` propagates turns out to depend on
    the surrounding preference state - it does propagate under Pester, and did not in a plain pwsh
    host - so a unit test of it proves nothing durable and would read as a guarantee it is not. The
    durable point is the opposite one: `break` is deterministic where `throw` is preference-dependent,
    which is why the product uses it. The evidence for the behaviour itself is the end-to-end run.

    Verified end to end before the fix was called done, by planting deliberately failing collectors
    in Services/: one failure now names the type in the report, and five consecutive failures stop
    collection at the fifth (the sixth is never attempted), report the subscription FAILED, exit 2,
    and remove the archive so the wrapper cannot consolidate it.
