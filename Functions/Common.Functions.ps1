function Write-RdaProgress
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Single, reusable progress reporter used across the tool.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Renders progress so it is visible in every host the tool runs in:
          1. Write-Progress - a live updating bar in an INTERACTIVE host.
          2. A throttled host line - because Write-Progress is a NO-OP in the
             non-interactive hosts the tool frequently uses (parallel `pwsh`
             stream processes, ForEach-Object -Parallel runspaces, transcripts,
             CI). In those hosts a single line per call is written so progress is
             still visible / captured by a parent process or transcript.
          3. An optional durable heartbeat line appended to -HeartbeatLogFile so
             a long run is observable live and after the fact.

        The function is intentionally generic: it knows nothing about
        subscriptions, collectors or staging folders. Every caller does its own
        trivial index/total math and calls this. Two display modes:
          - Determinate  (-Total > 0): "<item> (<index> of <total>)" + a percent.
          - Count-only    (-Total omitted or 0): "<item> (<index>)", no percent,
            for loops whose total is not known up front.

    .PARAMETER Activity
        Task label shown as the progress activity (e.g. 'Processing
        subscriptions', 'Revealing per-subscription reports').

    .PARAMETER CurrentItem
        Short description of the item being processed now (subscription/collector/
        folder name). Callers may enrich it, e.g. 'Sub-Prod-40 (already revealed)'.

    .PARAMETER Index
        1-based position of the current item.

    .PARAMETER Total
        Total number of items. 0 (or omitted) selects count-only mode.

    .PARAMETER Id
        Optional Write-Progress -Id to distinguish nested/parallel bars (default 0).

    .PARAMETER HeartbeatLogFile
        Optional path. When supplied, a timestamped progress line is appended so
        progress is durable even where Write-Progress is a no-op. A write failure
        never throws (best-effort).

    .PARAMETER NonInteractiveLine
        Force emitting the plain-text host line regardless of host detection.
        Useful for child stream processes whose stdout a parent captures.

    .PARAMETER BarOnly
        Suppress the non-interactive plain-text line entirely - emit only the
        Write-Progress bar (plus the optional heartbeat log). Use for
        high-frequency loops that run in non-interactive child processes (e.g.
        the per-collector Service Processing loop, which runs inside a parallel
        stream worker), where one line per item would flood the parent's
        captured stdout. Mirrors the pre-existing Write-Progress-only behavior of
        those loops while still routing through this single function.

    .PARAMETER Completed
        Clears the Write-Progress bar for this -Activity/-Id (and logs a
        completion line when -HeartbeatLogFile is set). Use once after the loop.

# =============================================================================
# Write-Log
#
# The single logging entry point for the whole tool. Moved here (from
# ResourceInventory.Functions.ps1) and defined Global: so EVERYTHING that logs
# routes through it - the orchestrator, the wrapper scripts, the metrics
# extension, and the Services/*/*.ps1 collectors (which run via '& $Module' and
# therefore only see Global functions, exactly like Protect-FreeTextValue).
#
# Default behavior is UNCHANGED from the original: with no switches it writes a
# severity-colored line to the console and, for Error severity, appends to the
# local error sink ($Global:ErrorLogFile). The two switches are purely additive
# so existing callers are byte-for-byte unaffected:
#   -NoConsole   suppress the console line (for high-volume diagnostics that
#                must NOT flood the terminal - metrics phase, per-collector
#                heartbeat). The line still goes to any file sink selected.
#   -ToDebugLog  also append the line to the consolidated debug log
#                ($Global:DebugLogFile) - the one file the heartbeat and metrics
#                diagnostics share. Its contents are UNSCRUBBED (real
#                service/resource names, raw exception text), and its zipping
#                posture is MODE-DEPENDENT: LOCAL-only under -Obfuscate, but
#                INCLUDED in the zip on a default (non-obfuscated) run, whose
#                report already carries real names. So treat anything written
#                here as potentially shipping to a report consumer, and never
#                write a credential or token to it.
#
# NOTE on scope: the per-line '[<8-char sub>]' tag is read via Get-Variable so it
# resolves the caller's script-scope $SubscriptionID without throwing when none
# is set. From a collector invoked via '&' that lookup may not cross the scope
# boundary, in which case the tag is simply omitted (the debug/error log
# filenames are already SubscriptionID-tagged, so nothing is lost).
#
# Deliberately NOT baked in (kept separate on purpose):
#   - Progress UI: that is Write-RdaProgress above (a bar, not a log line).
#   - Obfuscation scrubbing (Protect-DiagnosticText): only the SHAREABLE
#     Diagnostics_*.log needs scrubbing, and it is built once at packaging time
#     from aggregated health globals - NOT line-by-line here. Scrubbing every
#     log line would be slow and would destroy the local logs' raw
#     troubleshooting value, so it stays out of the hot path.
#   - Per-call logging from inside ForEach-Object -Parallel workers: concurrent
#     appends to one file are not safe. Those paths record into a thread-safe
#     bag and are logged as an aggregated summary on the main thread instead.

# Resolve the ONE directory this run writes everything under, and guarantee it is
# actually usable before anything derives a path from it.
#
# WHY THIS IS SHARED. The root used to be computed inline as
#   if ($PSVersionTable.Platform -eq 'Unix') { "$HOME/InventoryReports" } else { "C:\InventoryReports" }
# in SIX separate places across Run-AllSubscriptions.ps1 and ResourceInventory.ps1.
# The wrapper does NOT tell the inner script where it chose - the inner script
# derives its own - so the two agreed only because the arithmetic was duplicated
# identically. Any per-site divergence (a fallback applied in one place but not
# another) would leave the wrapper consolidating from a directory the inner script
# never wrote to. One function removes that class of bug by construction.
#
# WHY A FALLBACK AT ALL. The previous behaviour on a machine where that path is
# not writable was: creation fails, the failure is swallowed to Write-Verbose
# (invisible by default), and the run continues and fails later somewhere
# confusing. Verified failure modes:
#   - $HOME unset or empty (daemon, container, `sudo -E`, some CI runners). The
#     Unix branch then produced the literal '/InventoryReports' - the FILESYSTEM
#     ROOT - which a normal user cannot create.
#   - A managed macOS/Windows estate where MDM/DLP blocks writes to that path.
#   - Windows C:\ root writes refused without elevation.
# The tool should still produce a report in those cases rather than demand the
# operator diagnose a path problem, so an unwritable preferred location degrades
# to the OS temp directory with a LOUD warning naming where the output went.
#
# EXPLICIT REQUESTS ARE NEVER SILENTLY REDIRECTED. When the caller passed
# -OutputDirectory they named a location on purpose, very often a mount or share
# they intend to collect from. Quietly writing somewhere else would be worse than
# failing, so an unusable explicit path returns Ok=$false and the caller hard-fails.
# Only the DEFAULT location is allowed to degrade.
#
# PROCESS AGREEMENT. The chosen path is pinned into $env:RDA_INVENTORY_ROOT, which
# child processes inherit. -ParallelStreams launches stream workers as separate
# pwsh processes, so this is what makes a fallback chosen by the parent bind for
# every worker instead of each one re-probing and possibly deciding differently.
# It is an internal implementation detail, NOT a supported operator knob, and it is
# deliberately not a script parameter: adding one would change the wrapper's
# parameter surface and its passthrough key sets.
#
# Returns a result object rather than throwing, because the two callers hard-fail
# differently (the wrapper calls Exit-Wrapper, the inner script uses exit 1) and
# because a bare throw at script scope is SWALLOWED under this project's normal
# $ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'.
